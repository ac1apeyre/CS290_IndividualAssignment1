--Time spent on assignment--
Part 1: 4 hours (this includes learning git, coding, and running through test cases)
Part 2: 1.5 hrs + task 5 & EC

--Feedback--
      This assignment was a nice way to ease into javascript. Sample test cases would be much appreciated for future assignments and/or        the equivalent of j-unit tests. Could we also be pointed to a resource for how to use the in-browser debugger (F12)?

--Concerns/Bugs--
      Degenerate cases were not handled, as permitted by Professor Tralie.

--Extra Files--
      None
